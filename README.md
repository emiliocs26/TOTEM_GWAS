# TOTEM_GWAS

__firstpass_script.py__
script to perform the first second pass with TOTEM.

__secondpass_script.py__
script to perform the second pass with TOTEM.

__evaluation_firstpass.py__
script to plot the overrepresentation of FT genes in the TOTEM GWAS firstpass results.

__auxillary.py__
includes the Newton-Raphson-method to solve the non-linear equation system

__evaluation_secondpass.py__
script to plot the overrepresentation of FT genes and their interactors in the TOTEM GWAS secondpass results.

__get_interactors.py__
extract information about the interactors of FT genes published in FLOR-ID

__gene_annotation_script.py__
script to map each SNP to a gene using Araport11 annotation data. The result is saved as a csv file.

__plotting_emma_results.py__
script to make Manhatten plots out of the results from classical GWAS.

__emma_pvalue_indices.py__
creates a csv file that helps to map the scores from classical GWAS to the corresponding SNPs
